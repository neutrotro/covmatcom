COVariance MATrix COMparison: R function taking as input two datasets with measurements (rows) for a set of variables (columns; the same number of variables in the two datasets). covmatcom calculates the two datasets' covariance matrices, measures the overall differentiation between these matrices and separates the contribution of matrix orientation and matrix shape to the differentiation. The function produces as output: i) s1, an overall measure of differentiation, ii) s2, measuring the contribution of differences in orientation to s1, and iii) s3, measuring the contribution of differences in matrix shape to s1. See:  Garcia C. 2012. A simple procedure for the comparison of covariance matrices. BMC Evolutionary Biology 12:1-17 for details.
