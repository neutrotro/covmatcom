Description: The function takes as input two datasets with measurements (rows)
             for a set of variables (columns; the same number of variables
             in the two datasets), calculates the two datasets' covariance
             matrices, measures the overall differentiation between these
             matrices and separates the contribution of matrix orientation
             and matrix shape to the differentiation. The function produces
             as output: i) s1, an overall measure of differentiation, ii) s2,
             measuring the contribution of differences in orientation to s1,
             and iii) s3, measuring the contribution of differences in matrix
             shape to s1.
