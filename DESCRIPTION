Description: The function takes as input two datasets with measurements (rows)
             for a set of variables (columns; the same number of variables
             in the two datasets), calculates the two datasets' covariance
             matrices, measures the overall differentiation between these
             matrices and separates the contribution of matrix orientation
             and matrix shape to the differentiation. The function produces
             as output: i) s1, an overall measure of differentiation, ii) s2,
             measuring the contribution of differences in orientation to s1,
             and iii) s3, measuring the contribution of differences in matrix
             shape to s1. See:  Garcia C. 2012. A simple procedure for the
             comparison of covariance matrices. BMC Evolutionary Biology 
             12:1-17 for details. These s "squared" statistics are sensitive
             to the distribution of the differentiation across eigenvectors.
             The maximum s1 value (= 1) occurs in  the situation of "maximum
             concentration" of the differentiation, where one eigenvector
             explains all variation in the first dataset and another, 
             orthogonal eigenvector explains all variation in the second
             dataset. Situations with more than one greater than zero
             eigenvalues per dataset result in s1 values <1, even when the
             two eigenvector sets are mutually orthogonal. This is due to the
             use of squared values in the calculation of the s set of
             statistics. I am grateful to Dr Evan Remington for calling my
             attention to this algorithm limitation. As an alternative for
             cases in which detecting matrix orthogonality is important, 
             covMcom calculates absolute value-based versions of the same
             s  tatistics (s1Abs, s2Abs, s3Abs) not dependent on eigenvalue
             distributions and producing maximum s1Abs values (s1Abs = 1) in
             all orthogonal situations. The s1Abs values are decomposed in
             matrix orientation (s2Abs) and matrix shape contributions
             (s3Abs).
